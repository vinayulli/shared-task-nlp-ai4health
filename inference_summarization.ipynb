            "Summary: Patient’s Relative discusses the symptoms of a 2.5-year-old boy, noting persistent coughing, stools with fat content, and weight loss. The family seeks guidance on possible CF or TB, and plans to follow a diary-based approach for interim care. The Health Worker explains the diagnostic plan, emphasizing sweat testing as the primary test and the need to document stool types and hydration. The family is advised to plan travel to a nearby hospital if possible, and to document daily symptoms and hydration levels. The Health Worker outlines the diagnostic timeline, the purpose of tests, and the need for a supportive network. The patient’s condition is discussed in terms of possible underlying causes and how to monitor and manage symptoms. The family is encouraged to keep a detailed diary to guide testing and care. The Health Worker also mentions the possibility of a referral to a regional center for sweat testing and the need for a supportive network to ensure timely care. The summary ends with a final goal to provide accurate information, support, and a clear plan for future visits and tests.\n",
